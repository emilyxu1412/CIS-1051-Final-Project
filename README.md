# CIS-1051-Final-Project

This was done through Google Colab app, so some libraries were imported specifically for that.
I have used outside sources (cited) to help with my understanding and picking apart at the code and seeing if it had worked.
This project was a fun experience and journey, I learned a bit more about cybersecurity and realize the power that data can hold
and the possibility of hiding information in a picture in today's digital age.

The hardest part to encounter was the code not working properly, unfortunately I did not get enough time to really fix it, but
what I took away from this project is understanding another aspect of the code and picking it apart and realizing how it
affects today and future society.
