# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Project Steganography

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that encrypts and decrypts hidden messages in pictures (Essentially what steganography is).

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software will take a picture and a message, then start slicing secret messages and text into the hex code of the pictures. It should also be able to decrypt as well. I still need to watch videos and understand more on steganography.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to at least have the program be able to encrypt the code, or decrypt the code. If one process is easier than the other, I want to try to get that done because I like working from ground up and building my foundation.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Be able to do both ecnryption and decryption successfully. I do not believe I'm able to do both by the time the final rolls around.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Just the program actually working. i don't believe that my program will be 100% successful on the first run. So it will be a process to refine and tweak it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to watch Youtube videos and look up some references on how to make my program work.
